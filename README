python-snpp is a library which implements RFC 1861 - Simple Network Paging
Protocol. It provides two different approaches - one is is snpplib.py, which
is structured similarly to smtplib from the standard library. The other is 
Pager.py, which is a more object-oriented convenience wrapper around
snpplib.
